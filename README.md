# 100DaysOfCode
Starting a Udemy course ZTM

# Overview
I recently completed an online coding bootcamp and earend a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. However, even though I've learned the basics in the boot camp, I want to continue learning and I've started a Udemy course to build on that foundation. 
I'll document my learning here day by day that I learn. 

I've chosen the Complete Python Developer Course 2022. I really enjoyed working with python and I see the value in the language beyond just web development. 
My goal is to gain skills and move my career towards DevOps and Release Management so python will be very valuable going forward.
